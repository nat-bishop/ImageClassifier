Move the app running stuff from main to testgui for tests

put the bottom info bar on side. Group color harmony and color wheel.(make it all the way down). Have a button on the left that closes and opens.

maybe put + - buttons at bottom right next to palette.

check photos for UI

Make faster.

Try backing background black

Make clicking on image not open new image. Maybei t should have color informaiton instead?

Maybe use qt-extensions viewer.py. Then i can have color information on the image itself. Copy viewer.py to my drive and then check tests to see how it works

instead of list use sequence for type hints.

logging fixes. take all logging out of it. put that in main file only

color palette is used in every class -> probablky shouldnt be coupled like this. maybe use signals instead?

expandable section has no reason to require all the exrta shit (see picture to see better way to do it)

Maybe check qt-parameters for collapasble widget?

use QtPy to handle pyside2/pyside6 dependencys

I dont need the classifier map to the enum. i can just put the function inside the enum.
